## Why not [gists](https://gist.github.com/)?

I've been using gists for years, but sometimes it's not easy to
share (or use) code snippets not only because of GFW but also
in that gists have no MIME info (for front-end use).

For now, [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github) works fine.
So I will put some front-end related snippets here.

### List

#### [useFlasher](./src/useFlasher.ts)

```tsx
<div ref={useFlasher()}>{count}</div>
```
